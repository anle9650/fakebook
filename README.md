# fakebook

Fakebook is a social network platform. Users can add friends, direct message other users, and share posts for all of their friends to see. It is designed to be simple, responsive, and visually appealing. It is currently in the early stages of development. This is purely a visual and non-functional demonstration of the application.

### Assignment 2 
For the first check it compares the 2 passwords values and if they are not the same then we try and display a message and turn the color yellow. For the second check it iterates through the input elements and checks to see if any of the invalid characters are in the inputs and if they are then they are marked with yellow and a message is displayed. For the third check we iterate through the password value and check to see if atleast 1 character is lowercase, 1 character is uppercase, and 1 character is a number and for each of these we set a boolean that then we can see if the user does not have all 3 then display a message and change the color again. Finally for the security answer it utilizes an invisible class that has the css set the display to none and when the selection is changed it removes the invisible class.
